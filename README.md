# WIFINugget

Hardware designed and created by [HakCat](https://github.com/HakCat-Tech). 

The WIFINugget was designed for beginner hardware design and WIFI-based attacks, along with running [USB Rubber Ducky](https://github.com/hak5/usbrubberducky-payloads) scripts.

This repository contains scripts I design and use.
